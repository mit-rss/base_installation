# Base Installation

These instructions will guide you through the installation of the necessary software for this course.
This includes:

- Docker, a powerful tool for isolating development environments from the host environment
- Debian Linux, a unix-like operating system
- ROS, a very popular robotics toolkit
- The Racecar simulator

## Installing via Racecar Docker
Navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/mit-racecar/racecar_docker) for instructions on how to install the racecar docker image. We highly recommend you use Docker as it will isolate the system from your native operating system and make it much easier for you and the TAs to debug if things go wrong. 

Make sure to read the instructions up until the section on connecting to the physical racecar --- we'll get to that in a couple weeks! Also make sure you can get through the "Example Usage" section and run the simulator and RViz. It should look something like this:

You've now completed the base installation! Please move on to Lab 1A-B: [Intro to Linux](https://github.com/mit-rss/intro_to_linux) and [Intro to Git](https://github.com/mit-rss/intro_to_git).
